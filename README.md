* https://rosalind.info/problems/topics/genome-assembly/

ok so the genome assembly problems i want to work on in python, and if i solve 5 i can get a badge ... sweet so i have to solve these first

https://rosalind.info/problems/gc/

https://rosalind.info/problems/grph/

before i can solve the genome assembly ones

https://rosalind.info/statistics/top/

to make it to top 100, one needs to solve 205 problems and ive only solved 21 hmmmmmm

the second problem i was working on today isnt giving the right output ughhh hopefully i can figure it out tomorroww

im gonna work on the algorithm problems too bc i dunno https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=algorithmic-heights

im just going to do the problems in random order lol as long as i work on them every work day, thats good progress i think

# Goal for Mid-August: 
# 7. Constructing a De Bruijn Graph https://rosalind.info/problems/dbru/
to unlock it i have to solve: 
# 6. “Genome Assembly as Shortest Superstring”
# 5. “k-Mer Composition” <- 4. "RNA Splicing"
# 3. “Introduction to Set Operations” <- 2. "Counting Subsets" <- 1. "Inferring mRNA from Protein"

i want to get to the de bruijn graph problem in july and then i want to rewrite some of the problems in Rust in august ... but if im hired at mskcc, then i wont have time to rewrite them in Rust in august, ill be way too busy, but im planning that 1/3 of my personal statement will be about solving alignment problems in python on rosalind over the of summer 2024 so that should be good story i think, i dunno, lets see what my brother's thesis advisor thinks about that idea for the personal statement lol, thats the plan though

my code for one of the problems takes too long to run even though its using the itertools library ughhhh, it has to run within 5 mins otherwise the problem closes ... so thats what im working on this week it seems, great, wonderful, perfect, i want a cigarette even though i dont smoke, greattttt this is going to be a fun week of optimizing python code

too busy to get to do more rosalind problems this week, maybe ill go to the library on sunday to work on one of the problems, really want to get to the de brujin problem before august let see if that happens

im stuck on like 4 rosalind problems at the same time ... so close

ill come back to these problems next week or so, busy finishing up something else this week

best way to learn rust is to come up with programs to write, sometimes
